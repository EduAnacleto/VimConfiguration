# VimConfiguration
Vim Configuration Options

The "vimrc" (Vim resource configuration) file provides initialization settings that configures Vim every time it starts. This file can be found in “$HOME/.vimrc” for Linux/OSX and “$HOME/_vimrc” for Windows users. Inside Vim, type ":echo $HOME" to see the value of “$HOME” for your system.
